# Introduction to OOP
- **Definition of OOP**: A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code.
- **Key Principles**:
    - **Encapsulation**: Bundling the data and methods that operate on the data.
    - **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features.
    - **Inheritance**: Mechanism to create a new class using properties and methods of an existing class.
    - **Polymorphism**: Ability to present the same interface for different data types.

---

# Introduction to Design Patterns
- **Definition of Design Patterns**: General repeatable solutions to common problems in software design.
- **Importance**: Promote code reuse, better architecture, and efficient communication among developers.

---

# Categories of Design Patterns
- **Creational Patterns**
- **Structural Patterns**
- **Behavioral Patterns**

---

# Creational Patterns
- **Factory**: Creation of objects without specifying the exact class.
- **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.

---

# Structural Patterns
- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder to control access to an object.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

---

# Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer**: Notifies a group of objects about changes in the state of another object.
- **Strategy**: Enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime.
- **Command**: Encapsulates actions as objects, allowing parameterization of clients.
- **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

# Clean Architecture
- **Definition**: A software architecture pattern that emphasizes separation of concerns, organizing code so that it is independent of frameworks, UI, and databases.
- **Key Principles**:
    - **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
    - **Layered Architecture**: Comprises layers such as presentation, application, domain, and infrastructure.
    - **Testability**: The architecture facilitates automated testing by isolating components.
    
- **Relation to OOP**: OOP principles like encapsulation and abstraction support the goals of Clean Architecture, leading to maintainable, flexible systems.

# Example: Singleton Design Pattern
- **Purpose**: Ensures a class has only one instance.
- **Code Example**:
    ```javascript
    class Singleton {
        constructor() {
            if (!Singleton.instance) {
                Singleton.instance = this;
            }
            return Singleton.instance;
        }
    }
    ```

- **Use Cases**: Managing configurations, handling logging, etc.

---

# Conclusion
- **Recap**: OOP promotes structured, maintainable code, and design patterns provide solutions for common design problems.
- **Importance of Clean Architecture**: Combines OOP and design principles to create scalable, maintainable, and testable systems.
